2,"PLAY THIS GAME. Oops I mean, play this game if you are into good old fashion vintage Vegas fun + camaraderie. 

The table is located very near the buffet in The MGM Grand.  The rumor is that its the only one left on the strip and one of two in Vegas.  The Sigma Derby table is a place of pure magic, one of the only games that still takes and pays out quarters, each player sits with their own board and bets on which 2 tiny ponies out of five that they think will win. After each race the odds come up and you have 30 seconds to pick your ponies. I have yet to see the 200:1 odds hit, but because of the Derby Magic, its common knowledge that whenever you have the chance you bet the longshot....You don't want to be the only person who didn't! 

How can you not bet the 200:1 when the amazing oldtimer across from you with his oxygen in yells HORSE TIME! With the Derby comes amazing company like this. 

As much money as you can sit and lose playing this game, its ALWAYS worth it, and you STILL have a chance to walk away ahead. One night barely paying attention I won 150 quarters and danced my way back to my room with my tiny bucket of coins.

You end up sitting for hours with like minded Sigma Derby lovers drinking free cocktails and yelling at five tiny plastic horses. What more can you ask for? Find the Sigma Derby the next time your in Vegas, it only takes 1 quarter to get yourself into the game.",277,81.51,86.07,56.77,83.51,19.79,8.66,83.75,51.62,14.08,8.30,2.17,0.00,5.05,0.36,0.72,5.78,7.94,15.16,5.42,4.69,5.78,1.08,13.00,5.42,2.17,2.17,6.50,1.44,5.42,4.33,1.08,0.00,0.72,0.36,10.47,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.36,7.58,1.81,1.08,0.72,2.53,0.72,1.44,1.08,0.36,0.72,0.00,1.08,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.72,8.66,2.89,1.44,2.17,3.25,0.36,1.44,10.83,0.72,17.69,1.44,10.11,6.14,1.08,4.33,0.36,3.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.19,5.42,2.89,0.72,0.00,0.36,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.00,0.36

2,"I see a lot of negative reviews on here... I had no problems at all and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  My fiance and I only stayed here one night because I extended our trip to LV by one day.  We had stayed at the Flamingo and after checking out there made our way to Circus Circus.  The parking lot was a bit crazy, the craziest part being how to get to it from the strip.  We finally parked and made our way to check in, the line wasn't too bad but when we talked to the clerk she told us we'd be staying in the manor motor lodge which is a lot away, (its basically a series of smaller motel buildings).  I wasn't really in the mood to trek all the way over there and have to do that at night too, so she told us it would be 20$ extra to get the Skyrise tower (16th floor) which was actually in the main resort complex.  I agreed to that and we made our way to the room.  The room was clean and adequate, it was a little older but I didn't mind at all.  We had a nice view of the Stratosphere and Downtown, the beds and pillows were VERY comfortable.  After we got settled we headed to the Adventuredome which is nice because you don't have to pay a general admission price you just pay per ride.  They gave us a coupon at checking for BYGOF one ride so my fiance and I went on the Canyon Blaster roller coaster which was really fun and there was no line.  We played some of the chance games as well which were only 2$ a play (very reasonable, coming from someone who lives at the Jersey Shore, and we also got coupons for those games as well).  We then made our way to the buffet which I was very impressed with but will leave a separate review for that.  We played at the main casino with the circus tent above it.  I thought that was very cool and the free trapeze performance they put on was amazing and totally made my night.  That room they have is so cool you have slots, arcade games, mcdonalds, and a show all under one roof.  We went back to the room to sleep and left early in the morning but I would love to stay there again and for one night it was a great experience despite all of the negative reviews I am seeing on here.",424,56.64,78.19,53.08,89.18,23.56,11.32,89.15,59.91,15.33,10.61,3.54,5.19,0.71,0.47,0.71,4.72,8.96,13.44,8.25,7.55,7.55,1.89,15.33,5.19,1.65,2.12,1.65,3.07,5.66,4.48,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.14,0.47,0.47,0.47,0.47,8.96,0.71,2.12,0.71,1.42,1.42,2.83,1.65,0.94,0.00,0.47,0.71,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,9.67,6.60,0.24,0.94,1.42,0.47,8.49,4.48,0.71,15.57,3.30,10.14,3.54,1.42,2.36,1.42,1.65,0.00,0.00,0.94,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.47,0.00,10.38,4.72,2.59,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.18,1.42,0.47

We stayed here as we were doing a small music video production in Vegas. Upon our departure, I call down to the front desk to ask if they can send up to carts for our luggage. I tell him it's mostly camera hear, and he says he will have to charge me. I ask, ""how much?"" He comes back on the line and says ""hi sir, I lied, we don't charge! I'll send 2 carts up right now."" The 2 carts arrive with a bellman, who stares down our gear and says that's going to be $20 a cart (as if we hadn't paid enough already for our two suites). I tell him what happened, he gets on the phone with the guy at the front desk, essentially tells me I lied and that he never said they were free, I ask him to call his manager who comes, who is just as useless as Kurt, the original bellman. The manager apparently has never heard of customer service, and we end up paying for the cart.
